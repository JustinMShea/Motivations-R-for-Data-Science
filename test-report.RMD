## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Import Data


```{r sp500, message=FALSE}
library(quantmod)
getSymbols("^GSPC")

```

## Explore Data

```{r, message=FALSE}
chartSeries(GSPC)
```

## Transform

Lets explore percentage returns. 

```{r}
GSPC_percent <- diff(log(GSPC$GSPC.Close))
plot(GSPC_percent)
```


## Data Cleaning

Do we have any missing values? 
```{r}
sum(is.na(GSPC_percent))

head(GSPC_percent)
```

Remove first missing value and check again

```{r}
GSPC_percent <- GSPC_percent[-1]

sum(is.na(GSPC_percent))
```

## Modeling

Use the base R autoregresive model. We've already log $d$ifferenced so we'll define the $d$ in the $p,d,q$ order as $0$.

```{r}
arima(GSPC_percent, order=c(1, 0, 1))
```

We could also use the `forecast` packages `auto.arima` function to fit the best model, based on AIC, AICc, and BIC diagnostics.

```{r}
library(forecast)
auto.arima(GSPC_percent)
```

Note from the print out above, `auto.arima` also selects $d = 0$.
