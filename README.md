History
John Tukey, Ph.D Mathematics, Princeton. Went to work at Bell Labs.
The Future of Data Analysis, 1962.
Exploratory Data Analysis, 1977
Invented the term “bit”.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis
Tukey defined data analysis in 1961 as: "[P]rocedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data."[2]
Tukey's championing of EDA encouraged the development of statistical computing packages, especially S at Bell Labs. The S programming language inspired the systems 'S'-PLUS and R. This family of statistical-computing environments featured vastly improved dynamic visualization capabilities, which all owed statisticians to identify outliers, trends and patterns in data that merited further study.
Pete Nuar – Concise Survey of Computer Methods 1974
“The science of dealing with data, once they have been established, while the relation of the data to what they represent is delegated to other fields and sciences.”

William Cleveland, PhD Statistics Yale. – Data Science paper 2001
First paper to outline Data Science in its current form

Leo Brieman, Ph.D Statistics Berkley  - Two Cultures 2001
Bridges gap between statistics and computer science with Classification and Regression Trees. Creates the Random Forest
Maybe tree example from ISLR?

David Donoho – PhD Statistics Harvard. 50 years of Data Science
 
Jerome H. Friedman – A Gradient Boosting Machine
Current Kaggle competition winner

Data Scientist job title existed since 2008, but Proffessor of Data Science doesn’t
Data Scientist first appeared in 2008 at Facebook and LinkedIn

Scripting languages: the core of Data Science.
Scripting languages like R interfaces with Numerical computing libraries.
Package ecosystem allows scientists to contribute their work, with software they write.
Explosion in the sharing of work across scientific disciplines.

General Electives
Take your interdisciplinary courses seriously!
English class useful for data professionals? YES! Expressing your ideas during the project inception as well as at the project completion is important.  
Electives
Take as many statistics courses as you can, learning toward probabilities theory and anything that teaches you Bayesian methods. Consider minoring in statistics!
Linear Programming & Optimization
At the heart of everything.
Advanced Microeconomics, Steve Ziliak. Learn about the issues surrounding data and statistics in the real world. Learn how to critique statistical methods, random sampling, and design of experiments in the real word.
